## Software Setup

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::{discussion}

### Installing Python

[Python][python] is a popular language for scientific computing, and a frequent choice
for machine learning as well.
To install Python, follow the [Beginner's Guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) or head straight to the [download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Please set up your python environment at least a day in advance of the workshop.
If you encounter problems with the installation procedure, ask your workshop organizers via e-mail for assistance so
you are ready to go as soon as the workshop begins.

## Installing the required packages

[Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) is the package management system built into Python.
Pip should be available in your system once you installed Python successfully.

Open a terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) and run the following commands.

1. Create a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#create-and-use-virtual-environments) called `dl_workshop`:

:::{spoiler} On Linux/macOs

```shell
python3 -m venv dl_workshop
```

:::

:::{spoiler} On Windows

```shell
py -m venv dl_workshop
```

:::

2. Activate the newly created virtual environment:

:::{spoiler} On Linux/macOs

```shell
source dl_workshop/bin/activate
```

:::

:::{spoiler} On Windows

```shell
dl_workshop\Scripts\activate
```

:::

Remember that you need to activate your environment every time you restart your terminal!

3. Install the required packages:

:::{spoiler} On Linux/macOs

```shell
python3 -m pip install jupyter seaborn scikit-learn pandas tensorflow pydot
```

Note for MacOS users: there is a package `tensorflow-metal` which accelerates the training of machine learning models with TensorFlow on a recent Mac with a Silicon chip (M1/M2/M3).
However, the installation is currently broken in the most recent version (as of January 2025), see the [developer forum](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/772147).

:::

:::{spoiler} On Windows

```shell
py -m pip install jupyter seaborn scikit-learn pandas tensorflow pydot
```

:::

Note: Tensorflow makes Keras available as a module too.

An [optional challenge in episode 2](./2-keras.md) requires installation of Graphviz
and instructions for doing that can be found
[by following this link](https://graphviz.org/download/).

## Starting Jupyter Lab

We will teach using Python in [Jupyter Lab][jupyter], a programming environment that runs in a web browser.
Jupyter Lab is compatible with Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Chromium-based browsers.
Note that Internet Explorer and Edge are *not* supported.
See the [Jupyter Lab documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/accessibility.html#compatibility-with-browsers-and-assistive-technology) for an up-to-date list of supported browsers.

To start Jupyter Lab, open a terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows), 
make sure that you activated the virtual environment you created for this course,
and type the command:

```shell
jupyter lab
```

If you are running in a supercomputer, you should run instead

```shell
jupyter lab --no-browser
```

And make an SSH tunnel from your laptops to the compute node which is allocated.

## Check your setup
To check whether all packages installed correctly, start a jupyter notebook in jupyter lab as
explained above. Run the following lines of code:
```python
import sklearn
print('sklearn version: ', sklearn.__version__)

import seaborn
print('seaborn version: ', seaborn.__version__)

import pandas
print('pandas version: ', pandas.__version__)

import tensorflow
print('Tensorflow version: ', tensorflow.__version__)
```

This should output the versions of all required packages without giving errors.
Most versions will work fine with this lesson, but:
- For Keras and Tensorflow, the minimum version is 2.12.0
- For sklearn, the minimum version is 1.2.2

## Fallback option: cloud environment
If a local installation does not work for you, it is also possible to run this lesson in [Binder Hub](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/carpentries-lab/deep-learning-intro/scaffolds). This should give you an environment with all the required software and data to run this lesson, nothing which is saved will be stored, please copy any files you want to keep. Note that if you are the first person to launch this in the last few days it can take several minutes to startup. The second person who loads it should find it loads in under a minute. Instructors who intend to use this option should start it themselves shortly before the workshop begins.

Alternatively you can use [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). If you open a jupyter notebook here, the required packages are already pre-installed. Note that google colab uses jupyter notebook instead of Jupyter Lab.

## Downloading the required datasets
