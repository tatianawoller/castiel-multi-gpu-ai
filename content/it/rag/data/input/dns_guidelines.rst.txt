DNS guidelines
==============

DNS name
--------

It is possible to ask CINECA for a DNS name association to the virtual machine by sending an email to superc@cineca.it. 

In CINECA DNS, it is necessary to comply with the following rules:

- The **reverse** of the Floating IP (PTR record) must be set to the hostname of the VM, with the following naming convention:
  
   - for external users: <VM-name>.ext.cineca.it  
   - for CINECA staff: <VM-name>.cineca.it 
  
- The **record A** in the DNS is set accordingly to the previous point.
- If the service should be exposed with a different name, you can ask to set the **CNAME** with the chosen different name. If no other information is provided, only the record A will be set. 

Additionally, you might set up a CNAME with your DNS provider of choice. 

It is not possible to set the **PTR record** in CINECA DNS, if the record A has been set on an external DNS.
