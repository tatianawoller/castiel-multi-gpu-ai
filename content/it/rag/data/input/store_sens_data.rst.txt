Store sensitive data
====================

.. warning::
    
    Following CINECA access policies, you must inform CINECA in case the activity requires the loading and processing 
    of data that may fall under the GDPR (personal data), 
    to identify the appropriate security level; in any case, **sensitive or personal 
    data shall not be loaded and processed with CINECA resources without CINECA written authorization**.

If your application or workflow is processing sensitive data, besides getting the required authorization and signing with CINECA the Data Processing Agreement 
(for the appointment of the Data Processor), you need to take the necessary technical precautions to safeguard the data from unauthorized access. 

On CINECA HPC Cloud infrastructure, sensitive data can be stored on special **encrypted Cinder Volume** of type LUKS.  

By using the OpenStack Horizon dashboard, every user can create such volumes and then attach them to a virtual machine.

Due to a limitation of the crypto library, the **maximum size of each volume is 15 TB**.

Since LUKS are encrypted volumes, the time needed to create one can vary greatly in association to the size of the volume 
(most of the time is needed to encrypt the data). Here are some indicative times for the creation of different sized LUKS volumes from the dashboard:

- 1 TiB: 15 minutes
- 7 TiB:  2 hours
- 10 TiB: 3-4 hours

The user can access the data stored in such LUKS volumes by login into the corresponding virtual machine. 
Only the users with authorization to login into the virtual machine will access the data "in clear", even if it is encrypted by key.  

The keys used by the OpenStack volume encryption feature are managed by Barbican, the official OpenStack Key Manager service. 
Barbican provides secure storage, provisioning and management of secret data. This includes keying material such as Symmetric Keys, Asymmetric Keys, Certificates and raw binary data. 

.. note:: 
   CINECA HPC Cloud infrastructure is certified ISO 27001 since 2022 for `"Servizi informatici HPC in cloud per la ricerca in ambito life science" <https://www.cineca.it/sites/default/files/2024-06/ISO-27001-IT319237-ITA.pdf>`_.
