Database
========

`Trove <https://docs.openstack.org/trove/latest/>`_ is a database as a service (DBaaS) component of OpenStack. It is a pluggable 
service that supports multiple database engines.

Database as a service (DBaaS) is a cloud computing managed service offering that 
provides access to a database without requiring the setup of physical hardware, the 
installation of software or the need to configure the database. 

The Database service provides scalable and reliable cloud provisioning functionality for both 
relational and non-relational database engines. Users can quickly and easily use 
database features without the burden of handling complex administrative tasks. Cloud 
users and database administrators can provision and manage multiple database instances 
as needed.

The Database service provides resource isolation at high-performance levels, and 
automates complex administrative tasks such as deployment, configuration, patching, 
backups, restorations, and monitoring.
