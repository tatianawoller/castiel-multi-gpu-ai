At any moment, floating IPs can be de-allocated from a project using the available action for the floating IP.

.. important:: 

    It should be noted that if you de-allocate a floating IP from a project and then allocate one again, 
    the floating IP will not be same as before, as the floating IP is automatically select by the system from the available pool.

--------------------------------------

With the association of the floating IP to an instance, the instance becomes reachable from the external network.

- Click on *"Associate"* action on the right of the page *"Network â Floating IPs"*.
