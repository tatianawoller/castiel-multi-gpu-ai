CINECA HPC Cloud Model
=======================

The CINECA HPC Cloud infrastructure integrates and completes the HPC ecosystem, providing a tightly-integrated 
infrastructure that covers both high performance and high flexible computing. 
The flexibility of the cloud adapts better to the diversity of user workloads, while still providing high-end computing power.

.. note:: 
   CINECA HPC Cloud infrastructure is certified ISO 27001 since 2022 for `"Servizi informatici HPC in cloud per la ricerca in ambito life science" <https://www.cineca.it/sites/default/files/2024-06/ISO-27001-IT319237-ITA.pdf>`_.

CINECA Service Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CINECA HPC Cloud infrastructure is provided via an **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** model. 
In IaaS model, the Cloud Provider administrates the hardware and virtualization layers of the 
infrastructure and provides both computing resources (virtual CPUs, storage, network, GPUs...) and high-level APIs (dashboards, command line (CLI) tools) 
that users can employ to control the resources they were granted.

HPC Cloud use cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Cloud computing means **paramount flexibility**. With a cloud IaaS model, users are able to setup their project environment as they see fit, 
using all the infrastructure tools and resources and with the support provided by CINECA to meet their specific needs. 

CINECA users rely on the HPC Cloud infrastructure to address different use cases. The list below is not meant
to be exhaustive, but to provide examples of scenarios where HPC Cloud can be particularly useful.

Responsibilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While CINECA is responsible for the provisioning and maintenance of the hardware and virtualization layer (OpenStack), 
the users are responsible for anything they set up and install on their project (e.g. network setup, 
OS and applications on virtual machines, access to services and VMs).
A clear separation of roles in using the service is represented in the scheme below:

   * - **Name**
     - **Description**
     - **Role** 
     - **Responsibilities**  
   * - **CINECA**
     - Cloud provider
     - 
       - Administers physical infrastructure
       - Provides virtualization layer and API tools
     - 
       - Maintaining hardware and virtualization layer
       - User support
   * - **User Admin**
     - 
       - Users with granted budget on CINECA HPC cloud
       - Project PIs and collaborators in `CINECA UserDB <http://userdb.hpc.cineca.it/>`_
     - 
       - Create and manage cloud resources via the provided APIs (dashboard or CLI)
       - Responsible for all the resources they create (VMs, storage, networks,...)
     - 
       - Administer of the resources
       - Maintain VMs for which they have admin privileges
       - Implement security measures 
       - Backups/snapshots of resources during the project and at 
         the end of the validity period
   * - **User**
     - Users with granted access to the project VMs by User Admins.
     - Can utilize VMs and services they have been granted access to by User Admins.
     - Maintain the VMs for which they have admin privileges 

Any user (*âUser Admins"* or *âUsersâ*) with administration privileges on IaaS resources 
(VMs) has the responsibility to maintain the security (security patch, fix) on those 
resources. In particular, they have the responsibility to perform VMs and volume data 
backups. 

.. warning:: 

  Currently snapshots and backups of resources are stored in the same HPC Cloud infrastructure. 

From the project management perspective, CINECA will interact only with *âUser Admins"*. 
At the end of the project validity, the *âUser Adminsâ* will receive communication from CINECA 
staff that the project as expired with the date by when the resources will be removed. 
It is *âUser Adminsâ* responsibility to make copy of the necessary VMs or data before that date.
