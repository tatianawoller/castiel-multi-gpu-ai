Storage
=======

This component, based on the `OpenStack Cinder Service <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/>`_, allows the management of the 
storage space in cloud projects. 

Storage in CINECA HPC Cloud machines is based on Ceph platform. Ceph provides reliable 
distributed and scalable storage without a single point of failure.

Within OpenStack, it is possible to create different block storage devices, that can 
be used by instances (virtual machines) to store data persistently.

Volumes
-------

A volume is a block storage device that can be attached to instances. It provides 
persistent storage for data.

Snapshots
---------

A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of a volume. It can be used to create new volumes 
or restore existing volumes. Snapshots use the Copy On Write (COW) technique to create 
lightweight snapshots of volumes.

Backups
-------

A volume backup is a copy of a volume that can be used to restore data in case of 
data loss or corruption (**NOT IN FULL PRODUCTION**).
