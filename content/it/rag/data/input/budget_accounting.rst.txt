Budget and accounting
======================

Following the :ref:`cloud/general/cineca_cloud_model:cineca hpc cloud model`, the users manage autonomously the Cloud projects (tenants), one or more, to which they are associated.

To access Cloud resources, you need to get a CINECA HPC account. 
For detailed instructions on creating an account, please refer to the :ref:`general/users_account:How to become a User` section.

Each tenant is then composed by a pool of virtual resources (project quota/budget) which are defined in terms of:

- Number of vCPUs
- GB of RAM
- GB of storage
- Number of public IP addresses (floating IPs)

On request, you can be also granted

- Number of GPUs
- Additional storage for shares

Upon accessing the :ref:`cloud/os_overview/management_tools/dashboard:horizon dashboard` with HPC credentials, within the assigned tenants, 
you can autonomously create and manage all components of the virtual infrastructure 
(VMs, Networks, Security Policies, Load Balancer Policies, and so on) in compliance with 
the Access Policies accepted at the time of registration on UserDB (see the :ref:`cloud/operative/index_operative_manual:operative manual` for specific operations details).

When resource consuming operations, such as virtual machine creation, are performed, 
the request is validated against the maximum quota permitted for the current project. 

The users can also autonomously monitor the usage of the assigned resources in the OpenStack Horizon Dashboard, 
see :ref:`cloud/operative/compute_ops/instance_manage:instance: manage and monitor` page.
