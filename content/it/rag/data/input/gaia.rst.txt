GAIA
====

**PAGE UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Now under configuration, it is composed of 420 general purpose nodes and 
80 GPU nodes, also built on OpenStack (version to be defined). It is not only 
the biggest of the two infrastructures, but also the only accelerated one, 
mounting Nvidia GPUs models: A30, L40s and H100NVL. 

The HPC cloud infrastructure, named GAIA, is built using `OpenStack Overview` (version to be confirmed).

.. note:: 
  - It is possible to access GAIA via Horizon Dashboard at **TO BE ADDED**
  - For CLI access, the certificate chain can be downloaded here **TO BE ADDED**
