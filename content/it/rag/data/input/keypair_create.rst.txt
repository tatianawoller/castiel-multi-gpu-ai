- The private key will be automatically downloaded. Store this file securely as it will be needed for SSH access. 
  
.. warning:: 

   - The download of the private key will be done only when the keypair is created. It will not be possible to re-download it. If you lose the private key you will have to create a new keypair.
   - The public key can be seen in any moment by clicking on the generated Key Pair name. 

Best Practices
--------------

- **Secure Storage**: Store private keys securely. If lost, you won't be able to access your instances using that KeyPair.
- **Permissions**: Ensure private key files have restrictive permissions (chmod 600) to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Rotation**: Periodically rotate your KeyPairs and update instances accordingly to maintain security.
- **Backup**: Keep backups of your private keys in a secure location to prevent accidental loss.
- **KeyPairs** in OpenStack provide a secure and efficient method for managing SSH access to instances. By leveraging public-key cryptography, KeyPairs ensure that only users with the appropriate private key can access the instances, enhancing overall security.
