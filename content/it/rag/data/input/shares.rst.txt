Shares
======

The `OpenStack Manila service <https://docs.openstack.org/manila/latest/>`_ allows the creation of a filesystem that can be shared 
among virtual machines in the same tenant (intra-tenant) or in different tenants (extra-tenant).
This setup is particularly useful for applications that require consistent and 
simultaneous access to data across different instances.

In CINECA HPC Cloud infrastructure, it is possible to create shares of the following types:

- Generic type (NFS protocol)
- Cephfs type (CEPHFS protocol)

We suggest the users that need a shared filesystem to use the **generic type**.

.. note:: 
  
  **Only intra-tenant** shares are allowed on CINECA HPC Cloud infrastructures.
