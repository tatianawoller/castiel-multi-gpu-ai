The |ico1| community has access to the following CINECA HPC systems:

 * Leonardo

    - Booster partition
    - DCGP partition

 * Pitagora

.. important::
   The general environment defined on our clusters is the same for all the users, so EUROfusion users are invited to refer to the general documentation.
   Essential links below.

A presentation of each supercomputer, and of the access method via two-factor authentication (2FA), have been dedicated to the EUROfusion community. You can find the slides, including a report of the final Q&A session, and the recording at the following links (you should log in through the button :bdg-black-line:`Access as a guest`).

SLURM Partitions
----------------

On :ref:`hpc/leonardo:Leonardo` and :ref:`hpc/pitagora:Pitagora` *Job Managing and SLURM Partitions* sections, you can find the description of SLURM partitions and QOS to submit your jobs. Notice that EUROfusion users have dedicated partitions and QOS: you are allowed to use the **"_fua_"** partitions and the related QOS, besides the **"_all_serial"** partition which is shared among all users.


Low-priority jobs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1) **If all the budget assigned to your Project Account has been consumed**, you can keep running on Leonardo boost_fua_prod and dcgp_fua_prod partitions at low priority by requesting in your submission script the **qos_fualowprio** QOS:

.. code-block:: bash

  #SBATCH --account=<YOUR Project Account>
  #SBATCH --qos=qos_fualowprio

The QOS is *automatically* added to your Project Account upon budget exhaustion.

2) You can also request to run low priority jobs, **without having consumed all the budget of yout active Project Account**, by association to the **FUAL8_LOWPRIO** account on Booster and **FUA38_LOWPRIO_0** account on DCGP (write a mail to superc@cineca.it). You always need to specify also the **qos_fualowprio** QOS in your submission script.

.. code-block:: bash
  
   #SBATCH --account=<LOWPRIO Project Account>
   #SBATCH --qos=qos_fualowprio
