      "[QUESTION]: What GPUs are available on Leonardo?\n",
      "[ANSWER]: As of my last update in October 2023, Leonardo, which is part of the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking, is designed to be one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe. It is equipped with advanced GPUs to handle its high-performance computing tasks. Specifically, Leonardo is known to feature NVIDIA A100 GPUs. These GPUs are part of the NVIDIA Ampere architecture and are widely used in supercomputing and AI applications due to their high performance and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the most current and detailed information, I recommend checking the official EuroHPC or Leonardo supercomputer documentation, as hardware specifications can be updated or expanded over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "[QUESTION]: Is there any partition without gpus?\n",
      "[ANSWER]: Yes, there are partitions without GPUs. In many high-performance computing (HPC) environments, clusters are often divided into different partitions to cater to various types of workloads. Some common types of partitions include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **CPU-only partitions**: These partitions are dedicated to jobs that do not require GPU acceleration. They typically consist of nodes with multiple CPU cores but no GPUs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **GPU partitions**: These partitions are equipped with nodes that have one or more GPUs, suitable for tasks that benefit from GPU acceleration, such as machine learning, deep learning, and certain scientific computations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Large memory partitions**: These partitions have nodes with a significant amount of RAM, ideal for memory-intensive tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **High-throughput partitions**: These partitions are designed to handle a large number of smaller jobs efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Debugging partitions**: These partitions are used for testing and debugging code, often with shorter time limits and fewer resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine the specific partitions available in a particular HPC system, you should refer to the documentation or help resources provided by the system administrators.\n",
      "\n",
      "[QUESTION]: What GPUs are available on the Cloud?\n",
      "[ANSWER]: The availability of GPUs on the cloud varies by provider, but here are some of the most commonly offered GPUs from major cloud service providers:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**:\n",
      "   - NVIDIA Tesla V100\n",

Always check the latest offerings on the respective cloud provider's website, as new GPU options are frequently added.\n",
      "\n",
      "[QUESTION]: Can I associate a domain name to a vm?\n",
      "[ANSWER]: Yes, you can associate a domain name with a virtual machine (VM). This process typically involves several steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Obtain a Domain Name**: Purchase a domain name from a domain registrar if you don't already have one.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Set Up DNS Records**: Configure the DNS records for your domain. This usually involves setting up an A record or CNAME record to point to the IP address of your VM.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **A Record**: Maps a domain name directly to an IP address.\n",
      "   - **CNAME Record**: Maps a domain name to another domain name.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Configure Your VM**: Ensure that your VM is configured to handle incoming traffic on the appropriate ports (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS for web servers).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Update Firewall Settings**: Make sure that any firewalls (both on the VM and in the network) allow traffic to the necessary ports.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Test the Configuration**: Verify that the domain name resolves to your VM's IP address and that the VM is serving the expected content.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **SSL/TLS (Optional)**: If you're serving HTTPS, you may need to obtain and install an SSL/TLS certificate for your domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a simple example of setting up an A record:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Domain Name**: example.com\n",
      "- **A Record**: example.com -> 192.0.2.1 (IP address of your VM)\n",
      "\n",
      "After configuring the DNS records, it may take some time for the changes to propagate across the internet.\n",
      "\n",
      "[QUESTION]: What are the naming conventions I should follow when asking for a domain name for a vm machine?\n",
      "[ANSWER]: When naming a domain for a virtual machine (VM), follow these conventions to ensure clarity, consistency, and ease of management:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Descriptive and Unique**:\n",
      "   - Use a name that describes the VM's purpose or function.\n",
      "   - Ensure the name is unique within your domain namespace.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consistent Naming Scheme**:\n",
      "   - Follow a consistent pattern, such as `environment-role-app.domain.com` (e.g., `prod-db-mysql.example.com`).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Use Hyphens or Underscores**:\n",
      "   - If using multi-word names, separate words with hyphens (e.g., `web-server`) or underscores (e.g., `web_server`), but be consistent in your choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Avoid Special Characters**:\n",
      "   - Stick to alphanumeric characters and hyphens or underscores. Avoid spaces, slashes, and other special characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Include Environment**:\n",
      "   - Indicate the environment (e.g., `dev`, `test`, `prod`) to avoid confusion (e.g., `dev-web-server.example.com`).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Use Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN)**:\n",
      "   - Include the full domain name, not just the hostname (e.g., `web-server.example.com` instead of just `web-server`).\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Follow Organizational Standards**:\n",
      "   - Adhere to any specific naming conventions or standards established by your organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Keep it Short but Meaningful**:\n",
      "   - Aim for names that are short enough to be easily typed and remembered, but meaningful enough to convey the VM's purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Examples:\n",
      "- `prod-db-mysql.example.com`\n",
      "- `dev-web-app.example.com`\n",
      "- `test-api-server.example.com`\n",
      "- `staging-file-server.example.com`\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these conventions, you can create a clear and manageable naming structure for your VMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "[QUESTION]: What is Cineca AI and how do I enable it?\n",
      "[ANSWER]: Cineca AI is a suite of artificial intelligence services provided by Cineca, a leading Italian supercomputing center. It offers tools and resources for AI research, development, and deployment. To enable Cineca AI, follow these general steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Access the Cineca AI Portal**: Visit the official Cineca AI website and create an account if you don't have one.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Request Access**: Submit a request to access the Cineca AI services. You may need to provide details about your project or research.\n",

    "In the following section, we will implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the HPC documentation provided by Cineca to their users. As you will observe, the primary task in building RAG systems involves rigorously testing and evaluating different configurations of the information retrieval component to measure their impact on overall system performance. In a RAG pipeline, the generative AI component represents only the final stage of the process; the majority of the effort is dedicated to designing a robust retrieval system tailored to your data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the documents are in `.rst` format, so we are not concerned with reading files in other formats such as `.pdf` or `docx`. However, in real-world scenarios, this step can be handled using libraries such as marker, docling, or similar tools, depending on your needs. In this tutorial, we will not focus on document parsing, as our files are already in raw text format. Additionally, the choice of parsing libraries is highly dependent on the structure of your data and your specific preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## RAG building blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "The development and deployment of a RAG system typically involves five main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **loading** documents from a data source;\n",
    "2. **chunking** these documents in some (optimal) way;\n",
    "3. **storing** the chunked data in a vector database;\n",
    "4. **retrieving** relevant data to answer user queries;\n",
    "5. passing the **retrieve**d data to an LLM for generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps 1 to 3 are performed \"offline\", while steps 4 and 5 are executed \"online\".\n",
    "\n",
    "# Classical information retrieval approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical information retrieval systems operated by matching keywords in user queries with terms found in document collections, ranking documents based on **term frequency and inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)** without understanding the meaning of words. For example, bag-of-words models represented documents as unordered collections of terms, capturing term frequency but ignoring word order and context; search engines would then rank documents with the highest TF-IDF scores for the query terms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another classical approach was **exact match retrieval using tags**, where documents were labeled with controlled keywords (tags), and retrieval was based on finding documents with matching tags, as in early library catalogs or enterprise document management systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Semantic search\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, semantic search goes beyond exact term matching by **using vector representations (embeddings) of documents and queries**, capturing the meaning of words and their relationships. This allows retrieval systems to surface relevant documents even when they do not contain the exact keywords used in the query but are semantically related, enabling systems to understand that \"car\" and \"automobile\" refer to the same concept or that a document discussing \"heart attacks\" may be relevant for the query \"myocardial infarction.\"\n",

    "- The `BAAI/bge-m3 embedder` supports a maximum sequence length of approximately 8,000 tokens.\n",

However, the job runs for only 2 hours.\\n\\n   From this information, we have:\\n\\n   * T = 2 h (elapsed time)\\n\\n   * N = 1 node\\n\\n   * C = 32 CPUs (number of CPUs available on a Leonardo Booster compute node â\\x80\\x94 see :ref:`hpc/leonardo:Hardware Details`)\\n\\n   and, since:\\n\\n   .. math::\\n\\n      \\\\frac{\\\\text{Allocated}(\\\\text{CPU})}{\\\\text{Total}(\\\\text{CPU})} = \\\\frac{4}{32} = 0.125\\n\\n   .. math::\\n\\n      \\\\frac{\\\\text{Allocated}(\\\\text{GPU})}{\\\\text{Total}(\\\\text{GPU})} = \\\\frac{4}{4} = 1.0\\n\\n   the maximum of the resources requested per node is determined by the GPUs, therefore *R* = 1.0, and the billed hours are then calculated as:\\n\\n   .. math::\\n\\n      B_{H} = T \\\\cdot N \\\\cdot R \\\\cdot C = 2 \\\\cdot 1 \\\\cdot 1.0 \\\\cdot 32 = 64 \\\\text{CPUh}\\n\\n   This means the job consumes 64 effective CPU hours from the project's budget.\\n\\n----\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   * The **serial partition** is available for limited post-production data analysis and can be used even after a Project Account has expired. Usage of this partition is excluded from STDH billing (**free of charge**).\\n\\n   * By default, the amount of memory allocated per node is proportional to the number of CPUs requested.\\n\\n   * When nodes are requested in **exclusive mode** (see :ref:`hpc/hpc_scheduler:Scheduler and Job Submission` section), the entire node is reserved for the job, regardless of the specific resources requested. In such cases, the allocated resources may exceed the explicitly requested ones.\\n\\n   * The **resources per node** are listed in the **Hardware Details** section for each cluster. Refer to the :ref:`hpc/hpc_clusters:Cluster Specifics` section for the complete list of Cineca's HPC systems.\\n\\nBudget Linearization\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nA linearization policy governs the priority of scheduled jobs across Cineca clusters.

For GPU installations, the diagonalization is done on a single GPU (scalapack are not used\\n\\nWe suggest the following for optimal performance on Leonardo Booster:\\n\\n- prioritize pools over R&G , in particular for workloads with hundreds of planes or less in the z-direction, also for intra-node distribution. \\n- The minimum number of k-points per pool (kunit) in PWSCF is the number of k-points (`kunit=1`), while in phonon is usually `kunit=2`\"),\n",

However, a simple and effective way to obtain a container image provided with a CUDA installation is to bootstrap from an NVIDIA HPC SDK docker container, which already comes equipped with CUDA, OpenMPI and the NVHPC compilers. Such containers are available at the `NVIDIA catalog <https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/nvhpc/tags>`_. Their tag follows a simple structure, ``$NVHPC_VERSION-$BUILD_TYPE-cuda$CUDA_VERSION-$OS``,  where:\\n\\n1. ``$BUILD_TYPE``: can either take the value devel or runtime. The first ones are usually heavier and employed to compile and install applications. The second ones are lightweight containers for deployment, stripped of all the compilers and applications not needed at runtime execution.\\n2. ``$CUDA_VERSION``: an either take a specific value (e.g. ) or be a ``multi``.  The multi flavors hold up to three different CUDA version, and as such are much heavier. However, they can be useful to deploy the same base container on HPC with different CUDA specifics or to try out the performance of the various versions.\\n\\nIn the following we provide a minimal Singularity definition file following the above principles, namely: bootstrap from a develop NVIDIA HPC SDK container, install the needed applications, copy the necessary binaries and files for runtime, pass to a lightweight container.

    "\n",
    "A reranker is model specifically trained to rank the documents based on a query. In this notebook we are going to use a **cross encoder**. Cross encoders are models that process a query and a document **jointly** and output a relevance score for each document.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard semantic search approach uses bi-encoders, where **the query and documents are encoded independently into fixed-size embeddings**. The embeddings are then compared using some similarity measures. While bi-encoders are much faster at retrieval time (since document embeddings can be precomputed and stored in a vector database), they **often sacrifice accuracy due to the lack of interaction between the query and document during encoding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By **joint encoding the query with each chunk**, the model should capture **fine-grained interactions between tokens in the query and the document**, leading to accurate relevance judgments.\n",

    "Let’s examine how our metrics change after applying reranking."

      "[ANSWER]: Yes, there is a partition without GPUs. The \"lrd_all_serial\" partition on the Leonardo system does not have GPUs. It is designed for serial jobs with a maximum of 4 cores per job and a walltime limit of 4 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "[QUESTION]: What GPUs are available on the Cloud?\n",
      "[ANSWER]: The available GPUs on the Cloud are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Nvidia A30\n",
      "- Nvidia L40s\n",
      "- Nvidia H100 NVL\n",
      "\n",
      "[QUESTION]: Can I associate a domain name to a vm?\n",
      "[ANSWER]: Yes, you can associate a domain name to a virtual machine (VM). To do this, you need to request a DNS name association from CINECA by sending an email to superc@cineca.it. Here are the key points to follow:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Reverse DNS (PTR Record)**: The reverse of the Floating IP must be set to the hostname of the VM. The naming convention is:\n",
      "   - For external users: `<VM-name>.ext.cineca.it`\n",
      "   - For CINECA staff: `<VM-name>.cineca.it`\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **A Record**: The A record in the DNS will be set according to the hostname specified.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **CNAME Record**: If you need the service to be exposed with a different name, you can request a CNAME record with the chosen name. If no other information is provided, only the A record will be set.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, you can set up a CNAME with your preferred DNS provider. However, note that if the A record is set on an external DNS, the PTR record cannot be set in CINECA DNS.\n",
      "\n",
      "[QUESTION]: What are the naming conventions I should follow when asking for a domain name for a vm machine?\n",
      "[ANSWER]: When asking for a domain name for a VM machine, follow these naming conventions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **For external users**: Use the format `<VM-name>.ext.cineca.it`.\n",
      "2. **For CINECA staff**: Use the format `<VM-name>.cineca.it`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Replace `<VM-name>` with a descriptive name for your virtual machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, ensure that:\n",
      "- The reverse of the Floating IP (PTR record) matches the hostname of the VM.\n",
      "- The record A in the DNS is set accordingly.\n",
      "- If you need a different name for the service, request a CNAME with the desired name.\n",
      "\n",
      "[QUESTION]: What is Cineca AI and how do I enable it?\n",
      "[ANSWER]: **Cineca AI** is a collection of artificial intelligence packages optimized for Cineca's clusters. It includes packages like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and XGBoost, among others.\n",
      "\n",
      "To enable Cineca AI, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Load the deeplrn profile:**\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   module load profile/deeplrn\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Check available versions of Cineca AI:**\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   module av cineca-ai\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Load the desired version of Cineca AI:**\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   module load cineca-ai/<version>\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Verify the installed packages:**\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   python -m pip list\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Use a specific package:**\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   python -c \"import <package>\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "If you need to install additional packages, you can create a personal virtual environment:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Create a virtual environment:**\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   module load profile/deeplrn\n",
      "   module load cineca-ai/<version>\n",
      "   python -m venv <myvenv> --system-site-packages\n",

      "4. **Deactivate the virtual environment when done:**\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   deactivate\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "[QUESTION]: What are the names of the QOS queues available on the Leonardo supercomputer BOOSTER partition?\n",
      "[ANSWER]: The QOS queues available on the Leonardo supercomputer BOOSTER partition are not explicitly listed in the provided documents. However, the documents mention the partitions and some general information about job configuration.

You can request the resource via sbatch directive or srun option ``--gres=tmpfs:XX`` (for instance: ``--gres=tmpfs:200G``), with a maximum of 1 TB for the serial jobs. If not explicitly requested, the ``/tmp`` has the default dimension of 10 GB.\\n \\n * on the local SSD disks on DCGP nodes (3 TB  of capacity). As for the serial node, the local ``/tmp`` and ``/dev/shm`` areas are managed via plugin, which at the start of the jobs mounts private instances of ``/tmp`` and ``/dev/shm`` in the job's user space (``TMPDIR=/tmp``, visible via the command ``df -h /tmp``), and unmounts them at the end of the job (all data will be lost). You can request the resource via sbatch directive or srun option ``--gres=tmpfs:XX``, with a maximum of all the available 3 TB for DCGP nodes. As for the serial node, if not explicitly requested, the ``/tmp`` has the default dimension of 10 GB. Please note: for the DCGP jobs the requested amount of ``gres/tmpfs`` resource contributes to the consumed budget, changing the number of accounted equivalent core hours, see the dedicated section on the Accounting.\\n \\n * on RAM on the diskless booster nodes (with a fixed size of 10 GB, no increase is allowed, and the ``gres/tmpfs`` resource is disabled).\\n\\nJob Managing and Slurm Partitions \\n---------------------------------\\n\\nIn the following table you can find informations about the Slurm partitions for **Booster** and **DCGP** partitions.  \\n\\n.. seealso:: \\n  Further information about job submission are reported in the general section :ref:`hpc/hpc_scheduler:Scheduler and Job Submission`. \\n\\n.. tab-set::</td>\n",

It delivers &lt;em&gt;low latency&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;high bandwidth&lt;/em&gt; by leveraging &lt;strong&gt;NVIDIA Mellanox InfiniBand HDR&lt;/strong&gt; (High Data Rate) technology, powered by &lt;a href=\"https://nvdam.widen.net/s/zmbw7rdjml/infiniband-qm8700-datasheet-us-nvidia-1746790-r12-web\"&gt;NVIDIA QUANTUM QM8700 Smart Switches&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7885210\"&gt;Dragonfly+ topology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Below is an overview of its architecture and key features:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n  &lt;ul&gt;\\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hierarchical Cell Structure:&lt;/strong&gt; The system is structured into multiple &lt;em&gt;cells&lt;/em&gt;, each comprising a group of interconnected compute nodes.&lt;/li&gt;\\n\\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inter-cell Connectivity:&lt;/strong&gt; As illustrated in the figure below, cells are connected via an all-to-all topology. Each pair of distinct cells is linked by 18 independent connections, each passing through a dedicated Layer 2 (L2) switch. This design ensures high availability and reduces congestion.&lt;/li&gt;\\n\\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intra-cell Topology:&lt;/strong&gt; Inside each cell, a non-blocking two-layer fat-tree topology is used, allowing scalable and efficient intra-cell communication.&lt;/li&gt;\\n\\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System Composition:&lt;/strong&gt;\\n      &lt;ul&gt;\\n        &lt;li&gt;19 cells dedicated to the &lt;em&gt;Booster&lt;/em&gt; partition.&lt;/li&gt;\\n        &lt;li&gt;2 cells for the &lt;em&gt;DCGP&lt;/em&gt; (Data-Centric General Purpose) partition.&lt;/li&gt;\\n        &lt;li&gt;1 hybrid cell with both accelerated (36 Booster nodes) and conventional (288 DCGP nodes) compute resources.&lt;/li&gt;\\n        &lt;li&gt;1 cell allocated for management, storage, and login services.&lt;/li&gt;\\n      &lt;/ul&gt;\\n    &lt;/li&gt;\\n\\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive Routing:&lt;/strong&gt; The network employs adaptive routing, dynamically optimizing data paths to alleviate congestion and maintain performance under load.&lt;/li&gt;\\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\\n  \\n.. figure:: img/leo-net-all2all.png\\n   :height: 350px\\n   :align: center\\n   :class: no-scaled-link\\n\\n.. image:: img/spacer.png\\n   :align: center\\n   :class: no-scaled-link\\n   \\n.. dropdown:: Cell Configuration and Intra-cell Connectivity\\n   :animate: fade-in-slide-down\\n   :chevron: down-up\\n\\n   .. tab-set::\\n\\n      .. tab-item:: Booster</td>\n",

You can request the resource via sbatch directive or srun option ``--gres=tmpfs:XX``, with a maximum of all the available 3 TB for DCGP nodes. As for the serial node, if not explicitly requested, the ``/tmp`` has the default dimension of 10 GB.

A cleaning procedure will be enforced in case of improper use of the area.   \\n \\n * on the local SSD disks on the serial node (``lrd_all_serial``, 14TB of capacity), managed via the Slurm ``job_container/tmpfs plugin``. This plugin provides a *job-specific*, private temporary file system space, with private instances of ``/tmp`` and ``/dev/shm`` in the job's user space (``TMPDIR=/tmp``, visible via the command ``df -h``), removed at the end of the serial job. You can request the resource via sbatch directive or srun option ``--gres=tmpfs:XX`` (for instance: ``--gres=tmpfs:200G``), with a maximum of 1 TB for the serial jobs. If not explicitly requested, the ``/tmp`` has the default dimension of 10 GB.\\n \\n * on the local SSD disks on DCGP nodes (3 TB  of capacity). As for the serial node, the local ``/tmp`` and ``/dev/shm`` areas are managed via plugin, which at the start of the jobs mounts private instances of ``/tmp`` and ``/dev/shm`` in the job's user space (``TMPDIR=/tmp``, visible via the command ``df -h /tmp``), and unmounts them at the end of the job (all data will be lost). You can request the resource via sbatch directive or srun option ``--gres=tmpfs:XX``, with a maximum of all the available 3 TB for DCGP nodes.

      "[QUESTION]: Can I associate a domain name to a vm?\n",
      "[ANSWER]: Yes, you can associate a domain name with a virtual machine (VM). To do this, you need to request a DNS name association from CINECA by sending an email to superc@cineca.it. Here are the key points to follow:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Reverse DNS (PTR Record)**: The reverse of the Floating IP must be set to the hostname of the VM. The naming convention is:\n",
      "   - For external users: `<VM-name>.ext.cineca.it`\n",
      "   - For CINECA staff: `<VM-name>.cineca.it`\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Record A**: The DNS record A will be set accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **CNAME**: If you need the service to be exposed with a different name, you can request a CNAME with the chosen different name. If no other information is provided, only the record A will be set.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **External DNS**: You can also set up a CNAME with your DNS provider of choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Restrictions**: It is not possible to set the PTR record in CINECA DNS if the record A has been set on an external DNS.\n",
      "\n",
      "For detailed guidelines, refer to the DNS guidelines provided by CINECA.\n",
      "\n",
      "[QUESTION]: What are the naming conventions I should follow when asking for a domain name for a vm machine?\n",
      "[ANSWER]: When asking for a domain name for a VM machine, follow these naming conventions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Reverse of the Floating IP (PTR record)**:\n",
      "   - For external users: `<VM-name>.ext.cineca.it`\n",
      "   - For CINECA staff: `<VM-name>.cineca.it`\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Record A**: This will be set accordingly to the PTR record.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **CNAME**: If the service should be exposed with a different name, you can request a CNAME with the chosen different name. If no other information is provided, only the record A will be set.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **PTR Record**: It is not possible to set the PTR record in CINECA DNS if the record A has been set on an external DNS.\n",
      "\n",
      "To request a DNS name, send an email to `superc@cineca.it` with the desired VM name and specify whether you are an external user or CINECA staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "[QUESTION]: What is Cineca AI and how do I enable it?\n",
      "[ANSWER]: Cineca AI is a collection of artificial intelligence packages optimized for Cineca's high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. These packages include popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and XGBoost, among others.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How to Enable Cineca AI\n",

      "To enable Cineca AI, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Load the Cineca AI Module:**\n",
      "   First, you need to load the Cineca AI module. This can be done using the `module load` command. The specific version of the module may vary, so you might need to check the available versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   module load profile/deeplrn\n",
      "   module av cineca-ai\n",
      "   module load cineca-ai/<version>\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   Replace `<version>` with the specific version number you want to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Verify the Installation:**\n",
      "   After loading the module, you can verify the installation by listing the available Python packages.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   python -m pip list\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Use a Specific Package:**\n",
      "   To use a specific package from the Cineca AI suite, you can import it in your Python script or interactive session.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   python -c \"import <package>\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   Replace `<package>` with the name of the package you want to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional):**\n",
      "   If you need to install additional packages or want to create an isolated environment, you can create a virtual environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   module load profile/deeplrn\n",
      "   module av cineca-ai\n",
      "   module load cineca-ai/<version>\n",
      "   python -m venv my_env --system-site-packages\n",
      "   source my_env/bin/activate\n",
      "   pip install <package>\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   Replace `<package>` with the name of the package you want to install.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment:**\n",
      "   Once you are done working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   deactivate\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
