    "# Introduction to Ray Data\n",
    "Ray data is a Ray component based on the Ray Core functionalities presented in the notebook `1_ray_core.ipynb`. Ray data provides functions for scalable data processing, batch inference, and distributed training. For an example about video processing, check [this](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/streaming-distributed-execution-across-cpus-and-gpus).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic building block of Ray Data are Ray Datasets. Datasets are abstractions used to represent a distributed data collection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT NOTE: At the moment, Ray Data doesn't support the presence of a Ray Client connecting to a remote cluster. To solve this issue, all `ray.data` operations will be encapsuled inside Ray tasks. In this way, the task will be sent to the cluster and the ray data operations will be executed by the worker nodes.  "
