    "## Ray Architecture\n",
    "A Ray cluster is made by the following components\n",
    "- A single **head node**.\n",
    "- Zero or more **worker nodes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"Images/ray-cluster.svg\" alt=\"Structure of a Ray Cluster\" style=\"width:50%;\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The **head node is a special cluster node**, which, additionally to worker processes, hosts processes responsible for cluster management (mainly the GCS, the Ray Autoscaler). Usually the Ray driver process, which is the program responsible to submit jobs, is run on the Ray head node, but it can also run on another computer, and connect to a remote cluster.  \n",
    "The **GCS** (Global Control Service) is a service used for monitoring resource availability and to dispatch changes to other workers. The GCS is also used to save remote function definitions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **worker nodes** are regular nodes which do not run any cluster management process. These nodes simply contribute to the cluster by sharing their resources (CPUs, RAM, and GPUs) that will be used to execute the jobs. It is important to note that each node has a **scheduler** and an **object store**.  \n",
    "The nodes schedulers are used to schedule tasks and to evaluate if a worker has enough resources to execute a task. Similarly, the workers have an object store that is used to save intermediate results (i.e. variables and objects) to be used later. In case a node has no computing resources available but owns the data needed to execute the task, the data used will be serialized and sent to the worker node that was selected to execute the job.  \n",
    "\n",

    "# Specifying resources for Tasks and Actors\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining tasks and actors in Ray, **you can specify the resources** required for their execution. The Ray scheduler uses this information to determine which worker node is suitable for running the task.\n",
    "This feature is particularly useful as it provides a high-level yet powerful **mechanism to control resource allocation**. It helps prevent issues such as crashes due to out-of-memory (OOM) errors by ensuring tasks are only assigned to nodes with sufficient resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example: Suppose you have a cluster with 16 GB per GPU and you want to execute several LLMs (each using 8 GB of GPU memory). You can instantiate actors by specifying that they must use 0.5 GPUs. This will ensure that a maximum of two LLM actors are executed per node.\n",
    "Similarly, if you have functions that require a certain amount of memory and CPU cores to execute, you can specify them in the same way. These tasks can be scheduled on the same nodes that execute LLM actors, because LLM actors only use GPU resources and CPU cores and memory are available."
